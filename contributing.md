# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions to this project are highly appreciated! Whether you want to report a bug, suggest an enhancement, or contribute code, your help makes this project better.

## Ways to Contribute

- **Reporting Bugs**: If you encounter any issues or bugs, please [open an issue](https://github.com/bckelley/SimplePHPDB/issues) on GitHub. Provide detailed information about the problem you're experiencing and steps to reproduce it.
  
- **Submitting Enhancements**: Have an idea to improve the project? Feel free to [submit an enhancement](https://github.com/bckelley/SimplePHPDB/issues) on GitHub. Describe the enhancement you're proposing and any relevant details.

- **Contributing Code**: Found a fix for a bug or want to implement a new feature? You can [fork this repository](https://github.com/bckelley/SimplePHPDB/fork) and submit a pull request with your changes. Make sure to follow the project's coding standards and guidelines.

## Pull Requests and Branches

When contributing code changes or new features, please ensure that your pull requests are targeted towards the appropriate branch.

- **Main Branch**: The `main` branch represents the stable version of the project. It should always contain production-ready code. Pull requests to the `main` branch should only be made for critical bug fixes or well-tested features.

- **Testing Branch**: The `testing` branch is used for testing new features, bug fixes, and other changes before they are merged into the `main` branch. When submitting pull requests, target the `testing` branch as the base branch.

### Why Target the Testing Branch?

- **Testing Environment**: By targeting the `testing` branch, your changes will be tested in an environment that closely resembles the production environment. This allows for thorough testing and validation before merging into the `main` branch.

- **Isolation of Changes**: Targeting the `testing` branch helps keep the `main` branch stable by isolating untested changes. This ensures that the `main` branch remains reliable for users.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. **Create a Feature Branch**: Before making changes, create a new branch from the `testing` branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the changes you're making.

2. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes, following the project's coding standards and guidelines.

3. **Test Your Changes**: Thoroughly test your changes locally to ensure they work as expected.

4. **Submit Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, submit a pull request targeting the `testing` branch. Provide a clear description of the changes, including any relevant context or testing results.

5. **Review and Feedback**: Your pull request will be reviewed by project maintainers. Be prepared to address any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

6. **Merge into Testing**: Once approved, your changes will be merged into the `testing` branch and undergo further testing if necessary.

7. **Promotion to Main**: After successful testing and validation in the `testing` branch, changes will be promoted to the `main` branch through a separate pull request.
