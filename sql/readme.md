# SQL Directory

This directory contains SQL files for database setup. Users can also have one file, as long as the SQL statements are in the correct order (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE if necessary). The SQL files should be executed in the following order: create tables first, then alter tables.

## Files

- `create.sql`: Contains SQL commands for creating database tables.
- `alters.sql`: Contains SQL commands for altering database tables.

## Execution Order

1. **create.sql**: This file contains SQL commands to create tables in the database.
2. **alter.sql**: This file contains SQL commands to alter existing tables in the database.

## Note

- Tables and their structures in the SQL files are examples and can be modified as per project requirements.
